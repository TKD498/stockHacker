## Connecting to the Stock Market using Yahoo Finance

1. Install the `yahoo-finance` library using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install yahoo-finance
    ```
2. Import the `YahooFinance` class from the `yahoo-finance` library in your Node.js script:
    ```js
    const { YahooFinance } = require('yahoo-finance');
    ```
3. Create a new `YahooFinance` instance and provide your Yahoo Finance API key and secret:
    ```js
    const yf = new YahooFinance({
        key: 'YOUR_YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY',
        secret: 'YOUR_YAHOO_FINANCE_API_SECRET'
    });
    ```
4. Use the `YahooFinance` instance to query the stock market data. For example, to fetch the latest price for a specific stock symbol, you can use the `stock` method as follows:
    ```js
    yf.stock('AAPL')
        .then(stockData => {
            // do something with the stock data
        })
        .catch(error => {
            // handle any errors
        });
    ```

You can use the `options` method to fetch options data for a specific stock, and the `financials` method to fetch financial data from a stock's financial reports. Please refer to the [Yahoo-finance documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yahoo-finance) for more information and additional examples.

## Transcribing Live Calls using Twilio

1. Install the `twilio` library using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install twilio
    ```
2. Import the `TwilioClient` class from the `twilio` library in your Node.js script:
    ```js
    const { TwilioClient } = require('twilio');
    ```
3. Create a new `TwilioClient` instance and provide your Twilio API key and secret:
    ```js
    const client = new TwilioClient({
        key: 'YOUR_TWILIO_API_KEY',
        secret: 'YOUR_TWILIO_API_SECRET'
    });
    ```
4. Use the `TwilioClient` instance to connect to a live call and capture the audio. For example, to connect to a live call with a specific call sid and capture the audio, you can use the `calls` and `liveStream` methods as follows:
    ```js
    client.calls('CALL_SID')
        .liveStream
        .on('connected', stream => {
            // the stream is connected, start capturing the audio
            stream.on('data', data => {
                // do something with the audio data
            });
        });
    ```
5. To transcribe the audio data, use the `SpeechToText` class from the `twilio` library. For example:
    ```js
    const { SpeechToText } = require('twilio');

    // create a new SpeechToText instance
    const speechClient = new SpeechToText();

    // transcribe the audio data as it is being captured
    stream.on('data', data => {
        speechClient.recognize(data)
            .then(transcription => {
                // do something with the transcription
            })
            .catch(error => {
                // handle any errors
            });
    });
    ```

Please refer to the [Twilio API documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api) for more information and additional examples.

# Stock Data Live

A node.js package for getting live stock data.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:
```bash
npm install stock-data-live

```


## Usage

To use the package, import it in your node.js script:

```js
const stockDataLive = require('stock-data-live');
```

### Getting Current Stock Data

To get the current stock data for a specific symbol, use the `stockDataLive.getStockData` method. For example, to get the stock data for the Google symbol (GOOGL), you can use the following code:

```js
stockDataLive.getStockData('GOOGL').then(data => {
console.log(data);
});
```

This will print the current stock data for Google to the console. The data will include the current price, as well as other information such as the day's high and low prices, the volume, and more.

### Getting Live Stock Data

If you want to get a live stream of the stock data, you can use the `stockDataLive.getLiveStockData` method. This method takes a callback function as an argument, which will be called every time the stock data is updated.

For example, you can use the following code to log the updated stock data to the console every time it changes:

```js
stockDataLive.getLiveStockData(data => {
console.log(data);
});
```

This will log the updated stock data for Google to the console every time it changes. You can use this data in your own applications to build real-time stock tracking tools and more.

Note that this guide is just an example and there may be other ways to get live stock data in node.js. This is just one approach that you can use as a starting point.

tdameritrade.authenticate(clientId, clientSecret).then(accessToken => {
// Use the access token to make API requests
});
```
